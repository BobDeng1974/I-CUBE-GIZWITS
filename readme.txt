The I-CUBE-GIZWITS software expansion package consists of a set of libraries and application examples for STM32L4 Series microcontrollers acting as end devices.

I-CUBE-GIZWITS runs on the B-L475E-IOT01 IoT Discovery kit platform which support Wi-Fi® connectivity with an on-board Inventek module.

A sample application configures the Wi-Fi® parameters, and illustrates the various ways for a device to interact with the GIZWITS® IoT Cloud platform.

GAgent is GIZWITS’s hardware connectivity with the embedded system firmware that can operate in STM32. Devices access GIZWITS® IoT Cloud platform through the GAgent. GAgent provides the communication protocol between cloud and MCU on the module, so that, according to the protocol, developers can realize the communication between STM32 and cloud via Wi-Fi®.
